**Role.** Led awareness strategy and launch campaign for **OpenHPC’s transition into the Linux Foundation**.  

**Context.** Originally created at Intel, OpenHPC required a visibility boost as it entered neutral open-source governance. Although the technology was mature, the community needed a signal moment to drive adoption and new contributors.  

**Approach.** Positioned OpenHPC’s next release as a milestone, building a targeted awareness push across channels. **Secured a session at SuperComputing 2017**, leveraging the event as a launchpad with strong press, social, and community outreach.  

**Why it matters.** The effort delivered a **standing-room-only audience** at SC17, generated buzz among the high-performance computing community, and validated OpenHPC’s new governance model as a trusted, open collaboration.
