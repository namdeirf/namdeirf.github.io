**Role.** Spearheaded research, strategy, and execution of the **OpenAPI Initiative rebrand** under the Linux Foundation.  

**Context.** Adoption of the specification had plateaued. Market research showed developers were hesitant to commit because they were unaware that stewardship had shifted to the Linux Foundation.  

**Approach.** Launched a refreshed brand identity with a new logo and a **contributor badge campaign**, paired with a targeted awareness push to spotlight the Initiative’s new home and governance model.  

**Why it matters.** The rebrand clarified trust, governance, and community value, **unlocking renewed participation** and positioning OpenAPI for broader enterprise and developer adoption.
